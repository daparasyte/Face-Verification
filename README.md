# Face Verification System using Siamese Neural Network
This project is a face verification system that uses a Siamese neural network model. The system compares two input images and determines whether they are of the same person or not.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Tensorflow 2.0 or higher
- OpenCV 2.4 or higher

## Dataset
The dataset used to train the model is [Link](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/) (These images act as negative images for the model).
The positive images will be captured by the camera on your device (under the 'Collectig Positive & Anchor Images' in the notebook).
